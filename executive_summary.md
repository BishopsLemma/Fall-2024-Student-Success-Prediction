## Predicting Successful Graduation from Performance in Mathematics Courses

A data science project using a dataset from Iowa State University to predict the likelihood a student completes an undergraduate degree based on their succes in mathematics courses. 

# The Dataset

The original dataset consisted of the mathematics courses taken by 13,065 students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Iowa State University during a 10 year timeframe, from Spring 2014 to Summer 2024. We know if a student got below a C or not, if/when they graduated, when they took the course, and when they enrolled at the university. After cleaning the data set, we had 9,181 undergraduate students who took a total of 28 different courses between 2008 and before 2021, and had a graduation rate of 49\%. Graduation was indicated by a 1 if the student matriculated within 9.5 semesters; here Spring and Fall are counted as 1 semester and the Summer Session was counted a a half semester.
