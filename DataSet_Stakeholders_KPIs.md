# Student Success Prediction
A data science project using a dataset from Iowa State University to predict the likelihood a student completes an undergraduate degree based on their success in mathematics courses. 

## Dataset
The dataset we are using was provied by the registrar at Iowa State University; it contains a list of every student in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences that took a mathematics courses during the time period of the Spring 2014 semester to the Summer 2024 semester. For each student it indicates what semester they began at the university, their last registered semester, and whether or not they recieved a degree. For each course, it is indicated whether or not the student recieved a grade above a C-. 

## Stakeholders
- Mathematics Department administration.

## KPIs
- Find the course(s) that are good predictors for students succesfully completing an undergraudate degree.
