Questions about dataset:
- Can we get a key explaining what each column and value represents?
- Grades for each course?
- Can we organize dataset by student (replacing student ID with artificial numerical index)?

To-do:
- Ask our respective universities if they can provide similar datasets.
- In case we're not able to get our hands on grades data from respective university, need to formulate a projet topic using similar dataset (maybe College Scorecard or State-wide assessments?)

Project topic ideas:
- Classification problem: predict whether or not student will graduate in a 4-year period depending on their grades in certain math courses.
- 

Next meeting: Friday Oct 18 at 4:30 pm EST.
